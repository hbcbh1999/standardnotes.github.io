      %h2
        %a#preamble.anchor{"aria-hidden" => "true", :href => "#preamble"}>
        Preamble
      %p Notes are an essential part of human life, a tradition dating back tens of thousands of years. A person a thousand years ago may not have had much: a home, some food, family, and quite often, a journal. These thoughts, scribbled down on paper, belonged to no one but the authors themselves.
      %p Today, our notes are owned by Evernote Incorporated; by Google Incorporated; by Apple Inc. We do not own our own notes. They are owned by for-profit corporations, who are today at the mercy of paranoid governments looking to extend their reach as far as possible.
      %p These platforms also typically lock you in, so that it's either difficult or inconvenient to transfer to another service.
      %p Standard Notes is an open specification for a simple and secure system of organizing notes and groups of notes, and also publishing groups and notes onto the internet. Because it is an open protocol, a user need not be locked in to any application. Indeed, a user may even use multiple applications on different platforms to manage the same dataset.

        Introduction
      %p This document outlines the specifications for the client-server communications of the Standard Notes system. Any client can communicate with a Standard Notes server as long as it understands the server's requirements.

        Models
      %p The protocol consists of four main models:

        Encryption
      %p Encryption and security should always be top of mind with Standard Notes.
      %p It is important that there exist a seperation of concerns between the server and the client. That is, the client should not trust the server, and vice versa. Encryption keys are generated by stretching the user's input password using PBKDF2. The resulting 512 bit key is then split in two - the first half is sent to the server as the user's password, and the second half is saved locally as the user's master encryption key. This way, the server can never calculate the encryption key.
      %p The following are general requirements for clients and servers:
      %ol
        %li
          Note
          %code content
          must be encrypted locally before being sent to server.
        %li Client-server connections must be made securely through SSL/TLS.
        %li Upon receiving data from client, servers should encrypt sensitive data once more before storing with a key only the server knows. The server should decrypt this data before sending back to client.

        User Password Encryption and Key Generation
      %p
        %strong Client-side:
      %ol
        %li
          User enters "user inputted password" (
          %code> uip
          ) into registration or login password field.
        %li
          Client manipulates
          %code uip
          before sending to server as
          = succeed ":" do
            %code password
          %code uip
          using PBKDF2 with 3000 iterations, SHA512 as hashing algorithm, and user's email as salt.

          \- First half will be the

          \- Second half will be the user's global encryption key (

          ) (stored locally and never sent to server.)
