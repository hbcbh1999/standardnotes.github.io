      %p.condensed Protocol Specification
      %p.condensed.small.faded Version 0.10.0
      %h2
        %a#preamble.anchor{"aria-hidden" => "true", :href => "#preamble"}>
        Preamble
      %p Notes are an essential part of human life, a tradition dating back tens of thousands of years. A person a thousand years ago may not have had much: a home, some food, family, and quite often, a journal. These thoughts, scribbled down on paper, belonged to no one but the authors themselves.
      %p Today, our notes are owned by Evernote Incorporated; by Google Incorporated; by Apple Inc. We do not own our own notes. They are owned by for-profit corporations, who are today at the mercy of paranoid governments looking to extend their reach as far as possible.
      %p These platforms also typically lock you in, so that it's either difficult or inconvenient to transfer to another service.
      %p Standard Notes is an open specification for a simple and secure system of organizing notes and groups of notes, and also publishing groups and notes onto the internet. Because it is an open protocol, a user need not be locked in to any application. Indeed, a user may even use multiple applications on different platforms to manage the same dataset.

        Introduction
      %p This document outlines the specifications for the client-server communications of the Standard Notes system. Any client can communicate with a Standard Notes server as long as it understands the server's requirements.
      %h1
        %a#models.anchor{"aria-hidden" => "true", :href => "#models"}>
        Models
      %p The protocol consists of models on the server side and what are known as structures on the client side.
      %strong Server Models
      %ul
        %li User
        %li Item
      %strong Client Structures
      %ul
        %li Note
        %li Tag
      %p An <code>Item</code> model has a <code>content</code> field. The <code>content</code> field stores a JSON encoded structure that can be, in this case, a Note or a Tag.
      %p In this client-server model, servers are to be treated as dumb and uninformed. Because data is encrypted anyway, maintaining relationships between server side models is not very useful.
      %p The SN model pushes relationship mapping to the client, which clients today have no problem handling. This allows for improvements to be made to the data model on the client level, and not on the difficult-to-change server level.
      %p (You'll also notice that clients are not restricted to building just a notes app with this data model. You can build almost anything that can represent data as a JSON encoded object. Notes are a good place to start however.)

      %h2 Server Models
      %p All server models must have the following properties:
      %table
        %thead
          %tr
            %th name
            %th type
            %th description
        %tbody
          %tr
            %td uuid
            %td String (or uuid for some databases)
            %td The unique identifier for this model.


      %h3
        %a#user.anchor{"aria-hidden" => "true", :href => "#user"}>
        User
      %p A user model has the following properties:
      %table
        %thead
          %tr
            %th name
            %th type
            %th description

            %td The email of the user.
          %tr
            %td password
            %td String
            %td
              The password for this user.
              %em Note that passwords must be manipulated before being sent to the server. See here.
          %tr
            %td
              username (
              %em> optional
              )
            %td String
            %td A unique username used for sharing items. For servers that manage multiple Users, the username serves as a way to namespace presentations.

          %tr
            %td pw_function
            %td String
            %td
              The key derivation function (KDF) for this user. See Encryption for more.

          %tr
            %td pw_alg
            %td String
            %td
              The algorithm to use for the key derivation function. See Encryption for more.

          %tr
            %td pw_cost
            %td String
            %td
              The number of iterations to use for the KDF. See Encryption for more.

          %tr
            %td pw_key_size
            %td Integer
            %td
              The output key size of the KDF. See Encryption for more.

          %tr
            %td pw_nonce
            %td String
            %td
              A random string generated by the client during registration to compute the password salt. See Encryption for more.

      %h3
        %a#items.anchor{"aria-hidden" => "true", :href => "#items"}>
        Items
      %p Item models have the following properties:

        Encryption
      %p Encryption and security should always be top of mind with Standard Notes.
      %p It is important that there exist a separation of concerns between the server and the client. That is, the client should not trust the server, and vice versa.
      %p
        Encryption keys are generated by stretching the user's input password using a
        %a{"href" => "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function"} key derivation function.
      %P The resulting key is split in two — the first half is sent to the server as the user's password, and the second half is saved locally as the user's master encryption key. This way, the server can never compute the encryption key.
      %p SN attempts to make no final judgement on the best key derivation function to use, and instead defers to clients to make this decision. This allows for a future-proof implementation that allows clients to adjust based on present-day security needs.
      %p Note: client-server connections must be made securely through SSL/TLS.

        Key Generation

      %h3 Client Instructions
      %p Given a user inputted password <code>uip</code>, the client's job is to generate a password <code>pw</code> to send to the server as well as generate a master encryption key <code>mk</code> that the user stores locally to encrypt/decrypt data.

      %strong Authentication Steps
      %ol
        %li
          Client makes GET request with user's email to <code>auth/params</code> to retreive password function, algorithm, salt, cost, and key size.
        %li
          %p Client computes <code>pw</code> and <code>mk</code>:
          %pre
            %code
              :preserve
                key = pw_function(uip, pw_salt, pw_alg, pw_key_size, pw_cost)
                pw = key.substring(0, key.length/2)
                mk = key.substring(key.length/2, key.length)
        %li Client sends <code>pw</code> to the server as the user's "regular" password and stores <code>mk</code> locally. (<code>mk</code> is never sent to the server).

      %strong Registration Steps
      %ol
        %li Client chooses defaults for auth params (see Recommended Auth Params). Client also generates random string (at least 128 bits) as <code>pw_nonce</code>.
        %li Client computes <code>salt = SHA1(email + "SN" + pw_nonce)</code>.
        %li Client computes <code>pw</code> and <code>mk</code> using step (2) from Authentication Steps, and registers with <code>email</code>, <code>pw</code>, and <code>pw_nonce</code>, as well as the chosen defaults for auth params.

      %h3 Server Instructions
      %p The server must respond to GET requests made to <code>auth/params</code> and return the authentication parameters used for generating that user's password.
      %strong Steps
      %ol
        %li
          Server performs search for user with email in request parameters.
          %ul
            %li
              If user exists:
              %ul
                %li Compute <code>pw_salt = SHA1(user.email + "SN" + user.pw_nonce)</code>. Return <code>pw_salt</code> and user stored values for <code>pw_function</code>, <code>pw_alg</code>, <code>pw_cost</code>, and <code>pw_key_size</code>.
            %li
              If user doesn't exist:
              %ul
                %li Compute <code>pw_salt = SHA1(email + "SN" + SALT_PSEUDO_NONCE)</code>, where <code>SALT_PSEUDO_NONCE</code> is a static value stored by the server. This way, two consequent requests for a single email don't reveal whether this email is registered. Return <code>pw_salt</code> and recommended defaults for <code>pw_function</code>, <code>pw_alg</code>, <code>pw_cost</code>, and <code>pw_key_size</code>.
      %p

      %p For every item, if item is not public:
      %ol
        %li
          Generate a random key <code>item_key</code> (at least 256 bits).
        %li

      %ol
        %li

      %strong Decryption:
      %ol
        %li
          Decrypt <code>enc_item_key</code> using <code>mk</code> to get <code>item_key</code>.
        %li
          Split <code>item_key</code> in half; set encryption key <code>ek = first half</code> and authentication key <code>ak = second half</code>.
        %li
          Verify authenticity of message by computing <code>auth_hash = HMAC-SHA256(encrypted content, ak)</code>.
          If this value matches the <code>auth_hash</code> value returned by the server for this item, then proceed.
          Otherwise, the encrypted content of this item has been tampered with.

        Sharing/Publishing
      %p When an item is shared, it is accessible by the public. To share an item, you set a value for <code>presentation_name</code> on the item.
      %p When presenting, the client must remove local encryption from the item and all other referenced items the client deems related.
      %p When un-presenting an item, the client must encrypt the item and all other referenced items the client deems related.
      %p When the server returns an item to the client, it sends back an optional computed value for <code>presentation_url</code>. This URL is decided by the server. The server should also know how to respond to this URL.
