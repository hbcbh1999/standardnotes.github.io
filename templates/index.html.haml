        Preamble
      %p Notes are an essential part of human life, a tradition dating back tens of thousands of years. A person a thousand years ago may not have had much: a home, some food, family, and quite often, a journal. These thoughts, scribbled down on paper, belonged to no one but the authors themselves.
      %p Today, our notes are owned by Evernote Incorporated; by Google Incorporated; by Apple Inc. We do not own our own notes. They are owned by for-profit corporations, who are today at the mercy of paranoid governments looking to extend their reach as far as possible.
      %p These platforms also typically lock you in, so that it's either difficult or inconvenient to transfer to another service.
      %p Standard Notes is an open specification for a simple and secure system of organizing notes and groups of notes, and also publishing groups and notes onto the internet. Because it is an open protocol, a user need not be locked in to any application. Indeed, a user may even use multiple applications on different platforms to manage the same dataset.

        Introduction
      %p This document outlines the specifications for the client-server communications of the Standard Notes system. Any client can communicate with an Standard Notes server as long as it understands the server's requirements.
      %h1
        Models
      %p The protocol consists of four main models:
      %ul
        %li User
        %li Notes
        %li Groups
        %li Presentations
      %h2
        User
      %p A user model has the following properties:
      %table
        %thead
          %tr
            %th name
            %th type
            %th description
        %tbody
          %tr
            %td email
            %td Integer
            %td The email of the user.
          %tr
            %td password
            %td String
            %td
              The password for this user.
              %em Clients must enforce a 24 character minimum for passwords.
          %tr
            %td
              username (
              %em> optional
              )
            %td String
            %td A unique username used for presentations. For servers that manage multiple Users, the username serves as a way to namespace presentations.

      %h2
        Notes
      %p Note models have the following properties:
      %table
        %thead
          %tr

            %th type
            %th description
        %tbody
          %tr
            %td id
            %td Integer
            %td The id for this note. These ids are relative to the server hosting the data, and may change if a user initiated export and import occurs.
          %tr
            %td uuid
            %td String
            %td The unique global identifier for this note. This uuid does not change during new data imports.
          %tr
            %td content
            %td Text
            %td
              The JSON string encoded content of the note, with the following format:
              %pre
                %code
                  :preserve
                    {title: _note_title_, text: _note_text_}
          %tr
            %td loc_eek
            %td String
            %td The locally encrypted encryption key for this note.
          %tr
            %td
              group_id (
              %em> optional
              )
            %td Integer
            %td The identifier of the group this note belongs to.

            %td created_at
            %td Date
            %td The date this note was created.

            %td modified_at
            %td Date
            %td The date this note was modified.

      %h2
        Groups
      %p Group models have the following properties:
      %table
        %thead
          %tr
            %th name
            %th type
            %th description
        %tbody
          %tr
            %td id
            %td Integer
            %td The id for this group.
          %tr
            %td uuid
            %td String
            %td The unique global identifier for this group. This uuid does not change during new data imports.
          %tr
            %td name
            %td String
            %td The name of the group.

            %td The date this group was modified.

      %h2
        Presentations
      %p Presentations are how groups and notes are presented to the public. Groups and notes are by default unpresented and hidden from public view. However, a user may choose to make a group or a note publicly viewable.
      %p
        A group or a note with a presentation can be accessed by the presentation's

        Encryption
      %p Encryption and security should always be top of mind with Standard Notes.
      %p It is important that there exist a seperation of concerns between the server and the client. That is, the client should not trust the server, and vice versa. Encryption keys are generated by stretching the user's input password using PBKDF2. The resulting 512 bit key is then split in two - the first half is sent to the server as the user's password, and the second half is saved locally as the user's master encryption key. This way, the server can never calculate the encryption key.
      %p The following are general requirements for clients and servers:
      %ol
        %li
          Note
          %code content
          must be encrypted locally before being sent to server.
        %li Client-server connections must be made securely through SSL/TLS.
        %li Upon receiving data from client, servers should encrypt sensitive data once more before storing with a key only the server knows. The server should decrypt this data before sending back to client.
