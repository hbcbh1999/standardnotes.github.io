    <p><em>Notes so standard, they&#39;ll last forever.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I write is important to me. I want to be able to read it fifty years from now. A hundred years from now. So where do I go? Apple Notes? Google? Other private, short-lived, growth-oriented companies? No. What we need is something that <em>focuses</em> on durability and <strong>not</strong> growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Standard Notes is a basic notes app that delivers only the essentials in note taking. Because of its simplicity and resistance to growth, users can count on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A standard data format that allows portability and an extended lifetime</strong>. The more complex and custom a notes app becomes, the more likely your data becomes locked in to that platform, and the more buggy and laggy the application becomes. Because Standard Notes focuses on the &quot;standard&quot; format of a note, this data format, along with respective user-facing applications, are easy to maintain, and can exist for decades without issue. This means a less nomadic lifestyle for note takers.</li>
<li><strong>A set of cross platform applications that don&#39;t deteriorate over time</strong>. Simply put, applications that are simple are simpler to maintain. Applications that aim to survive an apocalypse must adapt to a different style. Because of this focus on durability, you won&#39;t be forced to switch over to a new system every time developers of your favorite notes app decide to change everything around or just completely abandon the project. And because the data format is built on top of the <a href="">Standard File</a> format, your Standard Notes data can be used with any app that supports your Standard File account.</li>
<li><strong>High security and privacy</strong>. Because Standard Notes uses the Standard File format, all your notes are encrypted on your device before being sent over the wire. This means that even if the server was hacked and all your data was stolen, the attacker would only see gibberish - only you can decrypt your notes with your password key.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-the-cut-for-note-basics-">What makes the cut for note &quot;basics&quot;?</h2>
<p>The basic form of a note is timeless: it has existed since the invention of paper. Most things we know about history is known through the journals of our ancestors. Standard Notes aims to simply translate the &quot;journal&quot; standard into its digital form. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>a basic note with a title and text</li>
<li>basic tagging system that allows a note to belong to one or multiple tags</li>
<li>the ability to search and filter notes based on tags or keywords</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard Notes also makes some modernization updates to bring the timeless note format into the modern age:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to share a note by generating a link to it</li>
<li>the ability to share a group of notes by generating a link to the group (this means you can share notes tagged &quot;blog&quot; to quickly create an online publication just based off your notes)</li>
<li>a Markdown supported editor</li>
</ul>
<p>And because data portability and durability are of utmost importance, all Standard Notes clients support:</p>
<ul>
<li>exporting all data as a human readable file</li>
<li>importing data from a previously exported file</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>To get started, download a Standard Notes app for your platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.standardnotes.org">Web</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/standardnotes/iOS">iOS</a></li>
<li><a href="">Mac</a> (Coming Soon)</li>
<li><a href="">PC</a> (Coming Soon)</li>
<li><a href="">Linux</a> (Coming Soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, choose a Standard File server to host your data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://n3.standardnotes.org">https://n3.standardnotes.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://n1.standardnotes.co.uk">https://n1.standardnotes.co.uk</a> (Coming Soon)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: because your data is encrypted before being sent to the server, it is not important to &quot;trust&quot; these servers. This means you can choose any server and rest assured that your data is secure.</em></p>
<p>If you&#39;re tech savvy, you can even <a href="">host your own Standard File server</a>.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll enter this server information inside the Standard Notes application. You&#39;ll then be able to sign in or register on this server.</p>
<h1 id="open-source">Open Source</h1>
<p>All Standard Notes apps are <a href="https://github.com/standardnotes">open source</a>. This means anyone can inspect the code and make sure it&#39;s not doing anything you wouldn&#39;t want it to do. And because the Standard Note format is openly published, anyone can build their own Standard Notes app. This means that you&#39;re not locked in to using our own suite of Standard Notes applications. This also means the lifetime of your notes is not limited by the lifetime of the Standard Notes application suite.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not something we consider often, but odds are, you as a human will outlive most of the private services you rely on today to manage your data. By building on top of a more open format, Standard Notes users don&#39;t have to worry about what would happen if Standard Notes got run over by a bus.</p>
<h1 id="the-standard-notes-format">The Standard Notes format</h1>
<p>The data format for Standard Notes is dead simple, and relies on two main &quot;structures&quot;, Notes and Tags. A structure is defined by the Standard File format <a href="">here</a>. The Note and Tag structures below are custom to Standard Notes, however, we propose that anyone building a notes app on top of Standard File use or build on this same structure.</p>
<h3 id="-notes-notes"><a href="#notes"></a>Notes</h3>
<p>Note structures have the following properties:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>name</th>
<th>type</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>title</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The title of the note.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>text</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The text body of the note.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="-tags-tags"><a href="#tags"></a>Tags</h3>
<p>Tag structures have the following properties:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>name</th>
<th>type</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>title</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The title of the tag.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
